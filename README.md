# Solar Eclipse Animation

This project is a visual representation of a solar eclipse, demonstrating the interaction between the sun, moon, and sky using HTML and CSS animations.

## Features
- A dynamic sky that transitions between day and night.
- A sun element that emits light during the day.
- A moon element that moves across the sky, creating a solar eclipse effect.

## How It Works
- The **sun** and **moon** are animated using CSS keyframes to mimic their motion and interaction during a solar eclipse.
- The **sky** changes color to simulate the transition from day to night as the moon eclipses the sun.
- The animation is designed to loop infinitely, showcasing the solar eclipse effect repeatedly.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the project.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and animation styles for the project.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Watch the solar eclipse animation play out in a continuous loop.

## Key CSS Animations
1. **Sky Animation (`@keyframes animate-sky`)**
   - Changes the background color of the sky to simulate day and night transitions.
2. **Sun Animation (`@keyframes animate-sun`)**
   - Adds a glowing effect to the sun during the day.
3. **Moon Animation (`@keyframes animate-moon`)**
   - Moves the moon across the screen, eclipsing the sun at the midpoint.

## Customization
You can adjust the animation speed, colors, or sizes by modifying the CSS styles in the `<style>` section of `index.html`.

## Preview
